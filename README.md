# USER STORY:

As a user, I want to search for the weather forecast of a specific city. When I type a name in the search bar - suggested names should auto-populate. When I enter a city name, the map should zoom to that area and a forecast appears. I can favorite a city so that it'll be posted to a drop down menu of "My Cities", for my direct viewing later.
